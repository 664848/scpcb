Requirements
•	Blitz3D v1.106
•	FastExt.bb (needs to be version 1.17)
•	FastExt.dll (is included in SCP:CB)

Note: Due to Blitz3D and FastExt.bb (the non-trial version) requiring paid-for licenses, they aren't included in the repository. You have to acquire them yourself.

Beware - the source code is perhaps more horrifying than the game itself!
